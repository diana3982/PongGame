# LAB 3

## Project Description

This project required for us to work with the msp430s,
and create an iteractive and dynamic game.
I chose to work on making pong.

The paddles represent the different players-- player 1 (bottom) and player 2 (top).
You score a point when your opponent is not able to guard their wall.
You win the game if you score 5 points.

* To compile: $ cd project-3-diana3982
